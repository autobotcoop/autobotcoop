# Day 1

When you first enter Act 1 after the Shield Maze, you wake up at the tavern Defender's Heart. This is your home base for the Act. Main thing is to check all the NPCs to get their quests. And your first new companion (**Woljif**) is in the jail in the basement.
While in the basement, make sure to open the secret room.

    Profit.

At some point before you leave Act 1, you'll want to purchase the Bag of Holding and the Icy Protector ring. The tavern is also where Hilron is and he is the merchant that allows you to buy mercenaries and to respec.

Head out and the first quest you want to do is The Divided City which takes you to the Market Square to find a route across the chasm. The Market Square is a larger area with a number of key events/items whichis why I head here first.

- First thing I do is head to the southeast corner of the map to save **Ember** before she gets killed. Besides, I love her Slumber hex in battles and want that ASAP :^)
- I then work my way to the center of the Market Square to build the bridge across the chasm to complete the quest and continue to the center of the map. Along the way, you will see a glowing blue area interact with this to unlock the **Aeon path**.
- Continue heading west and you will bump into Hulrun arguing with Ramien. Interact and the goal is to save Ramian.
- Continue west to the edge of the map by the big building up the stairs to rescue the Trapped Tieflings. Convince them to join the cause as they will make life easier during the final battle. This also unlocks the final battle for the Act.
- Swing toward the northwest part of the map to pick up the quest to rescue **Daeran** and head to the church to meet with Ramien. He is hard to find as he is invisible so walk around the gate of the church till he pops. Follow the dialog to get the quest to find Aranka, she is at the same place as the Daeran quest which is why I get both before I leave.

At this point I would leave the Market Square and head to the Library for the quest to find the Storyteller. There is no timer for him but if you wait too long, the wizards with him will be dead and trust me, you want them alive for the final battle as they will cast a 24 hour haste spell on you!

So head north to where the Storyteller is and you will be pulled into a Random Encounter along the way which is where you will meet **Nenio**. Finish this and continue to the Library for the Storyteller.

At the Library, you will interact with cultist dressed as crusaders and select the dialog paths marked by [Give in to the strange instinct] or something like that. Basically you talk them into rigging Gray Garrison with explosives. This unlocks the **Trickster path**.

When done with the Library, it will force you back to Defender's Heart so this is a good time to sell and rest for the night.

# Day 2

There is only one time sensitive quest left so I head there next. That is the Estrod's Tower quest. The main thing is that if you wait too long to do it, you will miss **Greybor** as he will be gone. No biggie but it was neat meeting and chatting with him.

I then head over to do the quest to save Daeran and here is where you will meet Aranka. Aranka will ask you to find her friend who she thinks is in the Market Square. While there, make sure you don't miss the hidden loot cache ...some nice stuff in there.

At this point I head back to the Market Square to finish off unlocking the **Azata path**. When first zoning in to the Market Square, there will be a lone crusader standing around just west of you (near where you built that bridge across the chasm). Talk to him and convince Hulrun not to kill the lone crusader. After this I go to where Hulrun normally is and convince him to help the Defenders. I continue on back to where Ramian is to complete that quest and then enter the church. Talk to them and this will complete the unlocking of the Azata path.

Leave the church and clear the rest of the zone if you haven't already.

Depending on how my party is doing, I will either head back to the Tavern to spend the night or I will head to Gwerm's house to knock that quest off the list. It's not time sensitive so no rush.

# Day 3

Now's a good time to do Woljif's quest and it will get you **Finnean**, the Talking Weapon. He can change into any weapon you want. And he scales as the game goes on. And at this point, it is just a matter of cleaning up the side quests while we wait for the attack on Defender's Heart. If you are out exploring when the attack occurs, you will get intercepted by a courier bringing you back to help defend. Main thing for the battle is kill the Alchemists before their bombs permanently damage the building. After the
battle, don't forget to loot the wagon with all the bodies. That is where the loot from the battle was.

From here on, you can wrap up any remaining quests and get ready for the assault on Gray Garrison. There is no timer on the Gray Garrison assault so feel free to take your time and perhaps, just randomly travelaround the map hoping for random combat encounters to raise cash to buy items before you complete the Act.

When ready, talk to Irebeth to trigger the Assault. The one warning about Gray Garrison is at the end, you have to decide what to do with the wardstone. If you are interested Aeon path, you must select the Aeon choice; otherwise, you are forever locked out of that path.
