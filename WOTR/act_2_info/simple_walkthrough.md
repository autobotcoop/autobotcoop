# Act 2 Simple Walkthrough

Taken from Reddit.

Since my Act 1 ([link here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/comments/pghsgm/spoilers_simplified_act_1_walkthrough_spoilers/)  post seemed to help a few folks out, I thought I would do a quick post on Act 2 to help with some things that might be missed that could be regretted later. Like the previous post, this will not be comprehensive walkthrough but will cover some things I learned (the hard way) about Act 2.

**There are no time sensitive quests in Act 2.** This actually created an exploit in Beta where you would just keep clicking the "Advance Time" button to build your crusade army to obscene levels. So now the game has a Morale setting for your army that will drop to red as time goes along unless you are moving toward Drezen.

# Crusade System

The Heroes of Might and Magic (HOMM) system of controlling your armies is introduced in Act 2 and for me, I enjoyed it until it was horribly broken late in the beta. So some of these comments may or may not apply with release.

* Don't forget to hire a General (Leader) for your army. He can buff, cast spells, etc and levels as you gain victories.
* You are limited to three units in you army that can only be expanded with the Master of Maneuver Feat of the army Leader. I will try to quickly get to 4 unit capacity as you will have 4 units available early on ... Footman, Archers, Clerics and Hellknights. As a matter of fact, I will often select a leader from the list so he already comes with Master of Maneuver Rank 1 . After that, no rush for more unit capacity until Act 3.
* Demon units will always target your Archers so I put them in a corner with the other units in front of them.
* Not sure how the spell oriented skills of the Leader will be on release. Early in beta they were OP ,,, then they were nerfed to useless.
* As you win some battles, you will get some free units like Headhunters. Problem is the limit on units in an army, there is no room for them. So I always ended up with a second army with these left overs. I called the my Junior Varsity squad :\^)
* Regarding how fast you need to move along to not damage the Morale too much. For me, I would let the army sit as long as I could to build them up with the weekly restock of troops. And I would then move the army only as needed to unblock Fortresses so my character could move forward with the quests (rescuing **Regill** is one good example). Once I cleared Leper's Smile, then I would start clearing the armies behind me. This seemed to rebuild the morale fast enough. And once I was done with all the player quests, I would move on to the Lost Chapel and Drezen. This pace always gave me glowing reviews by Queen Galfrey at the end of Act 2. \[Note that since the Morale thing was a last minute add in beta, it could have changed with release\].

# Merchant Items

There are two items to buy from the merchants that can have a huge impact on your game depending on your build.

* Wide Sweep Scythe ... it hits everything around your character (I don't have the exact info ,.. sorry). But when combined with Cleave style builds, it was amazing. It can be bought off the main merchant (Wiker???)
* Red Salamander Ring ... it unlocks, for any spontaneous caster, all the major Fire based spells ... Fireball, Controlled Fireball, etc. It is sold by the Scroll merchant. IT IS AMAZING ... note you can buy a second one in Act 3 in Drezen.

# Zone Information

I won't even try to talk about each quest area is Act 2 but there are a few things I did want to point out.

Leper's Smile

* You will have the option to head directly to the queen bug to kill her or loot first along the way. If you loot first, there is some really nice stuff. But your army will be wrecked and Queen Galfrey will be pissed. I just headed directly to the queen bug (follow the paths in the center going north). But I always wanted to test to see how much I could loot before I triggered the bad ending.
* You will be given the option to keep or burn the queen bug after the fight. You need to keep the queen bug to unlock the **Swarm that Walks path**.
* In the caves below, follow the left path to reach the undead. Near the end you will reach the boss group and they will continue to respawn until you click on the glowing chest in the middle of them to break the curse. Note that your don't get XP when they respawn otherwise that would have a great way to farm XP.
* In the chest near the respawning undead is the Wand of Zacharias. You are given the choice to keep it whole or destroy. You need to leave it whole to unlock the **Lich path**. I always take it unbroken anyway as it unlocks an area in the Lost Chapel that you wouldn't have access too otherwise. Free XP and some random loot.
* Also make sure to loot the claw of Terendelev in the cart. I have to assume it is part of that quest but it never was working in beta. \[Edit: Someone posted it is needed to unlock the **Dragon path** but I haven't confirmed.\]

Lost Chapel

* If you climb down to the bottom of the mountain (I usually wait until after all the big fights are over), you will find two items that you can add to a third in the Shrine of Desna that is also down there. I can't remember what they were named ... *update to add they are the: small sextant and small harp.* You can then play the Song of Elysium on the Shrine to meet Arueshalae by clicking the three "hand icons" in a certain order. Middle - Right - Left - Middle - Middle. ((god I hope I typed that correctly ... it's Friday and I've already had a few beers so my vision is a bit blurry ... let me know if it doesn't work )) This will allow you to talk to **Aruesahalae** and get her as a companion at the end of Act 2 rather than later in Act 3.
* If you have the intact Wand of Zacharias, you will be able to enter the lair of Zacharias who will offer you the secrets of being a Lich. I still go in there even if not Lich path for some nice loot but the fights are rough.

Anyway ... thought I would throw this out there for folks that might need some pointers.

Edit to add a link to a great video that gives great tips and tricks in General. I thought to add this because of the great point Samori Sykes makes about how much Religion stat impacts the ability of your party to travel in Act 2 and Act 3
